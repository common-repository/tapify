Tapify makes it easy for social media influencers to earn more as professional content creators.

== Description ==

Storefront by [Tapify](https://www.tapify.io/), our newest and shiniest tool, is a complete innovation in the Influencer marketing community.

After hundreds of requests (and years of servicing eCommerce store owners only),we've finally built and launched a tool exclusively for Influencers that makes it easy to discover and connect with top brands, promote partner products and even sell owned, digital content.

The difference? With Storefront, the entire interaction between Influencer, visitor (i.e., the influencer's community member), brand partner and eventual product purchase happens entirely on the Influencer's website. No longer do Influencers need to rely on affiliate links, while pushing beloved visitors to brand websites only to lose them forever. No longer do they need to rely on third-party transactional tools when selling digital content, like guides or exclusive video content.

In other words, Storefront puts more power in the hands of the Influencer. With Storefront, simply create your post, as usual, and link it to the product you're looking to promote. Whether you decide to link your post to our Partner Network inventory, which currently includes over 8,000+ of North American retail's
top brands, or your own Digital Content, you can do so in a few clicks and start earning right away.

Tapify has also built its reputation on superb community service. If you have any questions at all, feel free to reach out to hello@tapify.io. We'll respond in 10 minutes or less. Try us!
